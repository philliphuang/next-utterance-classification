aVin response to http://www.thecrimson.com/column/femme-fatale/article/2016/4/21/Policing-female-bodies/
p148
aVFair point
p149
aVEntitlement is not something you are born with. It's something that's given or taken. In the case of male sexual entitlement, it's something that in America is enforced by women via culture, unlike countries in the Middle East, Asia and Africa where male sexual entitlement is enforced by men via religion and force.\u000a\u000aYou claim male sexual entitlement is a problem. Now think of who comes to mind when you think of male sexual entitlement. What type of man catcalls yet demands his girlfriend not flirt with other men? What type of man brags to a platonic female friend about his promiscuous exploits? You know the answer to this question as well as I do.\u000a\u000aIn liberal America, privilege is not taken, it is given. Hook-up culture rewards a specific type of man: one who is manipulative and dominant. It's no wonder that such men grow to feel entitled. The problem should not be framed as a problem with men, but a problem with this specific type of man as well as the women who enable their behavior.

p665
aVhmm i\u2019ll revisit it after dinner then
p666
aVbut after that finding the type 1 error and power is r commands
p667
aVfor critical region I just used expected value of Y if Ha was true idk if that's "reasonable"
p668
aVok
p669
aVah
p670
aVyeah
p671
aVand use the fact that poisson is discrete?
p672
aVeither it's 1/10*60 or 1/20*60
p673
aVand you have 2 simple hypotheses for lambda
p674
aVuse Y as your test statistic
p675
aVit's just like
p676
aVbinomial?
p677
aVi did 2, it\u2019s not bad
p678
aVwhich example
p679
aVwait really?
p680
aVvery similar to lecture example

aVNot sure

aVgiven that the null and alternative are both discrete points
p752

p762
aVFor expo 1/xbar is the unbiased estimator for lambda I think
p763
aVYeah
p764
aVdifferent lambdas
p765
aVFor the Poisson the rate parameter is lambda*t
p766
aVoh i see what you\u2019re saying
p767
aVThen lambda is different
p768
aVisn\u2019t it just xbar since we\u2019re dealing with a poisson?
p769
aVIs the test statistic just 1/xbar?
p770
aVYeah
p771
aVdid you use lambda=1/10 for your null and lambda=1/20 for alternative for #1?
p772
aVFor the past 5 minutes
p773
aVIt's said that
p774
aVshould be coming in a few minutes

p2401
aVSigh

p2405
aVgetting the kids who are lower on the income ladder into the conversation is the real issue here
p2406
aVyeah
p2407
aVAlthough honestly the people who worry about a lot of these issues are white middle class kids (and their parents) who are going to end up fine anyway wherever they go
p2408
aVugh must lift things up and put them down
p2409
aVbut the effort is important

aVcan i jump right back into the 5x5 then
p2626
aVright
p2627
aVit\u2019s hard to tell without knowing what caused the injury last time

aVit *might* put less stress on the knee for you
p2629
aVwe'll decide tomorrow
p2630
aVfair enough
p2631
aVi\u2019m currently working high bar while rehabbing for example
p2632
aVthat said you will still get stronger either way

p2635
aVi mean if you want to lift the most weight
p2636
aVOr nah
p2637
aVShould I still switch to low bar
p2638
aVWho knows

p2703
aVMissing the crucial mustache cheek hair connection
p2704
aVAnd some growth on the cheeks
p2705
aVBut basically I have little more than a glorified chinstrap
p2706
aVIt's an improvement from the last time I tried no shave November 2 years ago
p2707
aVHaha fair enough
p2708
ag1
aVAlso don't get your hopes up
p2709
aVIt would be a prime time

aVDon't you know?

p2728
aVEveryone knows that untamed facial hair
p2729
aVHahahaha
p2730
aVOr maybe it's the beard
p2731
aVHopefully things take a turn for the better soon
p2732
aVWell
p2733
aVIn my dreams
p2734
aVI think it's just the repression from the semester catching up to me
p2735
aVThis tends to happen to me during breaks
p2736
aVDoing the same thing over and over again expecting change is insanity
p2737
aVBut it's been happening for a week
p2738
aVGotta punch it in the face
p2739
aVI have to face my fears Josh
p2740
aVLol haha
p2741
aVIdk
p2742
aVPlus you'll have somethings else clearly on your mind as you try to sleep
p2743
aVGood way to relax
p2744
aVMaybe masturbating right before going to bed
p2745
aVI'd honestly recommend
p2746
aVMaybe you should end your nights differently or something
p2747
ag1
aVI blame vacation
p2748
aVBut
p2749
aVI have no idea how to deal with shit like this
p2750
aVHonestly
p2751
aVIt was a first person dream too
p2752
aVNope
p2753
aVOh geez they didn't do it from behind
p2754
aVAnd the splash of blood
p2755
aVJesus H
p2756
aVThat's the common theme I see here
p2757
aVSo I actually saw the axe coming towards me
p2758
aVOver what goes wrong
p2759
aVHave Harry being caught in situations where he has no control
p2760
aVThe cloth was semi see through in the dream
p2761
aVTraps too tiny yo
p2762
aVThat shit was actually scary
p2763
aVBut why the beheading
p2764
aVBoth of those dreams
p2765
aVAw geez. By activation-synthesis theory, maybe your body's like: lol, muscles in pain b/c too swole, this would make sense if I were, say, getting ripped apart
p2766
aVIdk this shit is dark
p2767
aVBecause that's how your brain might convey terror
p2768
aVBut why do I keep dying
p2769
aVA lack of control
p2770
aVMaybe you're feeling a sense of helplessness
p2771
aVIt was very pleasurable
p2772
aVNaw
p2773
aVWas it painful?
p2774
aVOy vey
p2775
aVShit
p2776
aVAnd I got ripped to pieces
p2777
aVLast night I was a soldier but they gave me a faulty gun with no bullets
p2778
aVThat your unconscious is trying to tell you
p2779
aVSounds like something is being repressed by your conscious mind
p2780
aVI honestly have no idea where it comes from
p2781
aVTo have that keep happening every night
p2782
aVBecause that is quite strange
p2783
aVI've been working out practicing and studying cs
p2784
aVJust checking
p2785
aVNot at all haha
p2786
aVIs it at all influenced by what you've been doing during the day?
p2787
aVNight after night
p2788
aVVery bad stuff has been happening to me in my dreams lately
p2789
aV...
p2790
aVHoly shit that's terrifying
p2791
aVAnd then I woke up
p2792
aVI got a cloth tied around my face and then got beheaded
p2793
ag1
aVHighlight of last week was a dream in which
p2794
aVViolent things

p2801
ag1
aVAnd I have a garage
p2802

p2805
aV\U000feb5e
p2806
aVYour choice
p2807
aVOr fuck it in the pussy

aV\U000feb5e

p2849
aVmight as well get back on the gridn
p2850
aVWho's up for bench day Monday?
p2851
aVgotta love republicans

aV(alumni networking thingy)

p2856
aVLuckily IRL bitches fade from your memory
p2857
aVAnyway I just wanted to share that cute analogy
p2858
aVDad wat I'm sayin doe
p2859
aVThe worth the sacrifice part seems important
p2860
aVClose enough
p2861
aVPsh
p2862
aVIsn't it?
p2863
aVThat's different
p2864
aVWell
p2865
aVIt's not what gives you bliss or makes you happy 24/7, but what you're willing to suffer for -- what you genuinely believe to be worth the sacrifice.
p2866
aVYou'd know better than I do
p2867
aVGive me a sec
p2868
aVI read something on quota today that's similar
p2869
aVI think it's a very accurate characterization
p2870
aVExplains the attraction I suppose
p2871
aVTo Michelle yesterday
p2872
aVI was describing my love of cs to her
p2873
aVYours truly
p2874
aVWhere did that come from
p2875
aVSigh
p2876
aVAlso I'd like to share a quote: "CS is like a girl who hurts me all the time but I just can't get over"
p2877
aVSuch inspire
p2878
aVThe feels
p2879
aVMy new favorite soft drake song- look at what you've done
p2880
aVMm mm
p2881
aVLube may no longer be sufficient. We'll need to start stretching exercises soon.
p2882
aVAlso lubed up my asshole
p2883
aVMy body is ready for this semester
p2884
aVBack on the no masturbation, limited internet grind again
p2885
aVI dunno
p2886
aVWHY CANT ALL CLASSES BE WITH FRIENDS
p2887
aVbut that also restricts my choices for other areas. Goddammit why did I take 1011
p2888
aVso might end up doing 109-121 and leaving 61 for senior year
p2889
aVsince it\u2019s definitely more aligned with my interests
p2890
aVAlso es50 with friends lol
p2891
aVoh yeah, might prioritize 109 over 61
p2892
aVmaybe? idk
p2893
aVDefinitely want to take 61 with friends
p2894
aVEs50 senior year then?
p2895
aVThe thing is I don't know how fun 109, 61 and es50 would be at the same time while possibly tfing 121
p2896
aV(and probably more stat)
p2897
aV61-121 woot woot
p2898
aVYikes
p2899
aVyes
p2900
aVChris are you planning on taking 61 next fall?
p2901
aVit\u2019s weird, because of the international date line I\u2019m technically only flying for 13 hours
p2902
aVday after tomorrow
p2903
aV124 might be the top of the priority list Joshua
p2904
aVWhen are you back in the states?
p2905
aVNoice
p2906
aVin the most surprising place too (random hotel in New Zealand)
p2907
aVTwo days away
p2908
aVfinally have blazing fast wifi
p2909
ag1
ag1
aVI don't math
p2910
aVBut you can save your back for 139 and 111
p2911
aVPsssssshhhhhhhhhbbbhhhh
p2912
aVJust saying
p2913
aVResurrection policy to
p2914
aVAnd you are free to provide as well Harry
p2915
aVI wonder if Ben has any tips since he CA'd the class
p2916
aVgonna shop both regular and applied and see which I like better
p2917
aVWhat a guy
p2918
aV\u2764\ufe0f
p2919
aVKnill
p2920
aVAlso eeeeeey knoll
p2921
aVAnd I already thought this would be harder than last semester
p2922
aV#nosleep
p2923
aVI'm taking 3 of those courses (regular not applied 21b)
p2924
aVhey, I'd rather 4 pset classes than 3 pset classes and expos
p2925
aVLol 4 pset classes
p2926
aVWas about to say
p2927
aVthis semester's gonna suck donkey balls
p2928
aVthink I'm doing stat111, cs124, stat139, and applied 21b
p2929
aVI've noticed that since starting to look at cs124 material on the daily, my libido has plummeted to zero
p2930
aVI do have to say nothing kills your sex drive faster than studying cs theory
p2931
ag1
aVmassive gains
p2932
aV\U000feb5e
p2933
aVhaven't eaten there in a long time
p2934
aValso im planning on taking my parents to zoes saturday when we drive up
p2935
aVbah
p2936
aValso time
p2937
aVi don\u2019t need the drama
p2938
aVi don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works
p2939
aVto destress
p2940
aVuh i\u2019m not so sure about that one mister
p2941
aVgo ask michelle
p2942
aVto take the edge off
p2943
aVthis is why you need a girl
p2944
aVnext semester will be death
p2945
aV*death*
p2946
aVlost after the first line
p2947
aVi will humor you and at least look at the link
p2948
aVlike wtf, i decided to do cs to avoid numbers
p2949
aVthis is what i read about today: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FastFourierTransform.html
p2950
aVthere\u2019s a whole section on probabilistic algorithms
p2951
aVyes
p2952
aVinteresting
p2953
aV124?
p2954
aVit\u2019s pretty probability heavy in the latter half as well
p2955
aVso much math
p2956
aVis more or less past
p2957
aVi am so glad the gateway course to stat
p2958
aVis terrifying
p2959
aVthat
p2960
aVyikes
p2961
aVin terms of complexity, each single cs 124 lecture is more complicated than all of the theory in cs50 put together
p2962
aVyes unfortunate
p2963
aV-.-
p2964
aVfinal projects
p2965
aVoh god
p2966
aVi\u2019m definitely buddying up
p2967
aVsince both classes involve final projects
p2968
aVbarring rader/parzen/whoever is teaching the course being god-awful
p2969
aVi'm close to definitely taking 139
p2970
aVi\u2019ll definitely jump in the 139 boat with you
p2971
aValthough if phil decides he\u2019s not taking 171 and you definitely are taking 139
p2972
aVfair enough
p2973
aVi mean i\u2019m probably going to end up shopping 171 and 139 anyway before making the jump
p2974
aVsince there's a lot of overlap
p2975
aVbecause a lot of the reviews say that taking 111 and 139 concurrently helps
p2976
aVi need to pick my 3rd set class
p2977
aVcs 124 and stat 111 are givens
p2978
aVtaking
p2979
aVyes definitely
p2980
aVwait are you tking 111
p2981
aValso from what i\u2019ve seen so far, 124 is a bitch
p2982
aV139
p2983
aVstill torn between cs171 and stat139
p2984
aVbetter to write a 2 line script
p2985
aV\U000feb5e
p2986
aVi don\u2019t trust anything
p2987
aVgiven my struggles with the harvard printing system
p2988
aVno thank you
p2989
aVcan't they just make it default to one
p2990
aVgod why do they make you choose
p2991
aVno probs for me
p2992
aVhttp://www.thecrimson.com/flyby/article/2015/12/3/harvardkey-claim-it/
p2993
aVjust sign up for it
p2994
aVso i aint making one
p2995
aVand i heard it\u2019s buggy
p2996
aVyou have to create one
p2997
aVor something else
p2998
aVno
p2999
aVwait is harvardkey your email
p3000
aVlmao
p3001
aVi\u2019m going to write a chrome extension to automatically switch it to the HUID tab at some point
p3002
aVok this default to harvardkey is really bugging me
p3003
aVjust did 40 body weight squats without a hitch
p3004
aVYAYAYAYYAYAYAYYAY
p3005
aVIn good fitness news my knee appears to be all good
p3006
aVthis sounds like something out of a bad dream
p3007
aVwhy
p3008
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc40zIaCw6U
p3009
aV\U000feb5e
p3010
aVBut I shall return
p3011
aVI'm lazy?
p3012
aVUmm
p3013
aVwhat\u2019s your excuse
p3014
aVThat is rough
p3015
aVstill not completely healed
p3016
aVThat butt
p3017
aVsigh
p3018
aValthough i still can\u2019t low bar squat or conventional deadlift at capacity
p3019
aVA while
p3020
aVWell I haven't squatted since like
p3021
aVsmh
p3022
aVbruh i\u2019m at bodyweight for front squats 3x5
p3023
aVMy muscles haven't atrophied completely since then
p3024
aVBut that's fine
p3025
aVSince gym attendance
p3026
aVIt will have been a month
p3027
aVbro have you been working out?
p3028
aVIs it me or are those biceps larger than usual
p3029
aV\U000feb5e
p3030
aVbut not full on retard
p3031
aVi\u2019m stupid
p3032
aVit\u2019s ok i trimmed the neck bruh
p3033
aVThat sounds dangerously close to the neckbeard
p3034
aVbasically got the d-bag chinstrap of peace going on right now
p3035
ag1
aVneed more cheek growth and the cheek mustache connections sigh
p3036
aVEveryone's got to start somewhere
p3037
aVit\u2019s just noticeably patchy
p3038
aVThere you go
p3039
aVyeah i mean i don\u2019t have the worst facial hair genetics by asian standards
p3040
aVIt should be possible
p3041
aVI mean there have been examples of impressive Asian beards
p3042
aVbut imma finish out this month
p3043
aVmaybe in 2 years i will be able to grow flowing locks of face hair
p3044
aVI guess that's a good thing
p3045
aVdefinite improvement over my capabilities 2 years ago
p3046
aV\U000feb5e
p3047
aVhalfway through just don\u2019t shave january and the results are not too promising
p3048
aVbut can't feel my face is the ultimate pop carbon copy
p3049
aVsong
p3050
aVthat is also a good
p3051
aVi like the hills better
p3052
aVand can't feel my face is catchy as hell
p3053
aVbut niggas be like NAH
p3054
aVDAS WAT IM SAYIN DOE
p3055
aVat what he does
p3056
aVhe's actually a pretty good artist
p3057
aVit is a good song
p3058
aVthe fact that it came from 50 shades notwithstanding
p3059
aVlol
p3060
aVgoing through the weeknd songs and this one seem dangerous https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe_iCkFsQKE
p3061
aVthere we go
p3062
ag1
aVit\u2019s theory
p3063
ag1
aVmore like
p3064
aVno excuses
p3065
ag1
aV\U000feb5e
p3066
aV*cs work
p3067
aVbut the work remains undone
p3068
aVIt all depends on how you define productivity
p3069
aVoh by all means it was nice
p3070
aVHey man
p3071
aVhelped michelle debug and then we ended up chatting for a while
p3072
aVthis afternoon was not productive at all
p3073
aVMUST DO CS
p3074
aVyeah anyway
p3075
aVyup
p3076
aVEating dinner now but that I can definitely relate to
p3077
aVbut just by virtue of having people who tend to analyze the shit out of everything, shit gets complicated
p3078
aVnot saying that\u2019s necessarily right
p3079
aVfor blue collar families for example, the traditional gender roles are more apparent
p3080
aValso this is definitely magnified by being at harvard
p3081
aVnothing ever comes easy
p3082
aVyup
p3083
aVfucking hell
p3084
aVso the answer is that the ideal man is a combination of all that
p3085
aVbut at the same time the conviction and no-bullshit attitude present in that caricature are to be admired and valued as well
p3086
aVobviously the caricature of the dumb misogynistic beefhead man\u2019s man is something that should be avoided
p3087
aVand the cycle continues
p3088
aVthen i end up being too distant to compensate
p3089
aVbut i feel like i can come off as too intense as a result
p3090
aVthat\u2019s a whole other can of worms
p3091
aVi've always been at odds with hookup culture so i'm biased from the get-go
p3092
aVhell if i know
p3093
aVor be pro-women without emasculating yourself?
p3094
aVhow do you be a man without being a misogynist?
p3095
aVi mean it\u2019s a fine line in the modern society
p3096
aVah
p3097
aVwhich there are
p3098
aVthere\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea basically
p3099
aVas opposed to scarcity
p3100
aVi've heard of all the rest
p3101
aVwhat is an abundance mentality
p3102
aVaka not be a pussy in that sense
p3103
aValso mentally I just have to remind myself constantly to take people off the pedestal, have an abundance mentality instead of oneitis and never sacrifice my core values
p3104
aVthat i can understand
p3105
aVwhat I mean is I just have to be more honest with myself
p3106
aVwhich to me on a my-personal-values level is kinda ethically sketch
p3107
aVhmm
p3108
aVso really i was just being dishonest with myself
p3109
aVhiding under the guise of just trying to be helpful
p3110
aVbut with the girls there was that other motive as well
p3111
aVi helped chris because he\u2019s a friend
p3112
aVi helped michelle with her blog today because she\u2019s a friend and that\u2019s what friends do
p3113
aVlike i\u2019m happy to help people
p3114
aVit\u2019s more of a mentality thing
p3115
aVI mean people working together on psets is rather common
p3116
aVWhat kind of boundaries
p3117
aVNaw I should have set boundaries
p3118
aVThat the most demanding people happened to be women you were attracted to
p3119
aVIt just coincided
p3120
aVPeople don't need a pussy for you to help them with stuff
p3121
aVEh
p3122
aVSee: last semester
p3123
aVBesides Phil who probs wouldn't care
p3124
aVHey man I'm guilty as well
p3125
aVY'all have heard that side of me
p3126
aVWell
p3127
aVBut another to bend over backwards for the opposite sex
p3128
aVIt's one thing to be respectful
p3129
aVEVERYTHING IS NEBULOUS
p3130
aVI mean nice is a nebulous term
p3131
aVEmasculation sounds more dignified
p3132
aVAlso the pussification of the male (myself included) is a thing
p3133
aVMy best friend from high school constantly told me to be less nice
p3134
aVThough I don't agree with it completely there is truth
p3135
aVI've heard that rhetoric a lot before
p3136
aVWe all want the same thing; at least assholes are honest about it
p3137
aVSigh
p3138
aVAlthough I do see the argued logic for girls going for assholes
p3139
aVSwimming pool full of liquor baby
p3140
aVToo bad I'm watching my carbs
p3141
aVI mean it's pretty simple: walls full of sugar and you dive in it
p3142
aVBut I get the general gist
p3143
aVAnd I'm still not sold on an explicit event being necessary
p3144
aVSmart people make things even more complicated
p3145
aVRight
p3146
aVI feel like also our perceptions are further complicated by the fact that we go to Harvard
p3147
ag1
aVNow if only it'd actually pick up the Dumbbells
p3148
ag1
ag1
aVFind your own
p3149
aVRemember to multiply by i folks
p3150
aVNope that's my outlet
p3151
aVThat's why I drown my problems in alcohol
p3152
aVWith u being a pronoun for anyone and everyone
p3153
aVLoving u is complicated
p3154
aVIt is
p3155
aVThis shit is complex
p3156
aVBah
p3157
aVGeeze
p3158
aVThat's just a compliment
p3159
aVI'm guessing walking up to someone and telling them you think they have a hot ass is too explicit in most cases
p3160
aVThat counts
p3161
aVOr you could just be blunt af. In high school someone accidentally slipped a note into my friend's locker (wasn't meant for her). Literally said , "date me? --Brett"
p3162
aVNot a blowoff
p3163
aVBasically there's a moment where you get explicitly rejected or naw
p3164
aVLike how explicit do you have o be
p3165
aVAnd it depends how one goes about that moment I presume
p3166
aVFine
p3167
aVThe buildup can be gradual but there's a single moment
p3168
aVDoes that still count as a critical point
p3169
aVBut what if it's neither
p3170
aVYes
p3171
aVOr min?
p3172
aVAn absolute max?
p3173
aVCrossing the rubicon
p3174
aVCalculus
p3175
aVAn ultimatum
p3176
aVOh god
p3177
aVA point of inflection somewhere
p3178
aVBut there is a critical point
p3179
aVSo does the intent have to be concentrated in a single event?
p3180
aVOk sure that happens
p3181
aVBut the key word is intent
p3182
aVBecause from what Mario has told us it was a gradual thing with him and Caroline
p3183
aVEventually probably
p3184
aVDoes hooking up have to be in the cards
p3185
aVDefine romantic
p3186
aVBut I do agree it's kinda vague
p3187
aVHmm
p3188
aVI guess asking someone else to do something with you later where the intent is explicitly romantic in nature
p3189
aVSo do I have to ask her out to dinner old fashioned way
p3190
aVMeals at Harvard are social events
p3191
aVCause like
p3192
aVOk fair point
p3193
aVThe asking out not Star Wars
p3194
aVThat part of American culture is rather hazy to me
p3195
aVEz
p3196
aVDude it was during class day
p3197
aVDon't judge
p3198
aVAlso I have always been a little confused as to what amounts to asking someone out
p3199
aVHey I take what I can take
p3200
aVI guess you and Natalie have the Harvard connection...
p3201
aVRight in the pussy
p3202
aVHm, didn't think you had a thing for white girls
p3203
aV\U000feb5e
p3204
aVAfter I fucked her
p3205
aVYOU KILLED PADME
p3206
aVTo Josh's message
p3207
aVWELL THEN YOU REALLY ARE LOST
p3208
aVThat is true...
p3209
aVWHO SAYS I AM NOT VADER
p3210
aVONLY A SITH DEALS IN ABSOLUTES
p3211
aVIt was rushed
p3212
aVYou have to issue the ultimatum bruh
p3213
aVOkay fine then
p3214
aVTHAT DOESN'T COUNT
p3215
aVShe said she wasn't sure then ended up not going idk if that counts
p3216
aVI asked here if she was going
p3217
aVI thought you didn't end up asking
p3218
aVWhat was the conversation
p3219
aVI barely saw her after that conversation
p3220
aVNah I meant for Mather formal
p3221
aVAlso define blow off
p3222
aVWe're all gonna make it bruh
p3223
aVI cri evrytime
p3224
ag1
ag1
aVWait was this after I left?
p3225
aVStupid autocorrect
p3226
aVThat's what I mean to type
p3227
aVDammit
p3228
aVWelp
p3229
aVwell
p3230
aVIt was very rushed
p3231
aVWell
p3232
aVLike the last time I saw her before break
p3233
aVI missed this
p3234
aVIt was a bit hurried
p3235
aVWait when was this?
p3236
aVYeah
p3237
aVOh really?
p3238
aVShe just blew it off
p3239
aVI did technically ask Nina
p3240
aVYou gotta try bruh
p3241
aVJOSH
p3242
aVI'm thinking
p3243
aVJOSH
p3244
aVHmm
p3245
aVLike explicitly
p3246
aVWell
p3247
aVJosh have you ever actually asked a girl out?
p3248
aVWhat
p3249
aVAlso something hit me
p3250
aVThat's good to hear
p3251
aVAlso I do concede that max is a nice guy
p3252
aV\U000feb5e
p3253
aVHey man that facebook$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
p3254
aVFair enough
p3255
aVBut I think she knows what she's in for
p3256
aVI mean I warned her gently
p3257
aVThat is really weird
p3258
aVUgh I forgot about her
p3259
aVOr they'll keep in touch
p3260
aV*cough Christine
p3261
aVSo most likely she understands it will be a short one
p3262
aV...or like 5
p3263
aV3 years is the really weird one
p3264
aVBut he's graduating
p3265
aVAlso that is true

p5514
aVwhoa PRO HAX
p5515
ag1
ag1
aV7 is done friends
p5516
ag1
aVI think I came up with a better explanation for 5e
p5517
aVBut U can be anything from 0-1
p5518
aVBecause that probability comes from when U is given
p5519
aVYah
p5520
aVwas it finding the marginal?
p5521
aVoh josh what justifies integrating over all U again?
p5522
aVI think that's the intuition Yaoweh gave us
p5523
aVThen you integrate over all possible values of U
p5524
aVBasically you can find the conditional pdf probability if U is given
p5525
aVI will focus on those two
p5526
aVWowza ok
p5527
aV!!
p5528
aVbut you\u2019re supposed to take an integral
p5529
aVbecause jacob gave us enough to get started
p5530
aVyeah it might be helpful to ask blitz about 3 in general
p5531
aVAs a prophet can do
p5532
aVUnless I misinterpreted Yaoweh's guidance
p5533
aVI think I can explain it but it might be worth asking blitz
p5534
aVJacobbbb
p5535
aVPoop
p5536
aV3a is not that simple
p5537
aVUmm
p5538
aVI have thoughts about 3b
p5539
aVDo we plug in 0.5 for U?
p5540
aVWas 3a correct?
p5541
aVI will focus on those
p5542
aVHuzzah
p5543
aVwe have 3b and 7 left
p5544
aVHow was last nights progress?
p5545
aVBae
p5546
aV4 is done
p5547
aV1 and 3 are eh
p5548
aVpretty sure of 2 and 6
p5549
aVi have stuff written down for 1-3 and 6
p5550
aVok lol
p5551
aVso it is ambiguous what constitutes completed
p5552
aVecon is graded very leniently
p5553
aVbut ok
p5554
aVi\u2019m so confused by those cryptic statements
p5555
aVI'm gearing up for stat soon
p5556
aVanyways he's probably going to be MIA for the next couple of hours
p5557
aVtechnically he did
p5558
aVwell
p5559
aVchris didn't finish
p5560
aVpretty bad
p5561
aVew was ec bad this week for you guys?
p5562
aVMight crash at the start of OH
p5563
aVFeel awake now though
p5564
aVBaeee
p5565
aVUp at 7
p5566
aVSlept at 2:30am ish
p5567
aVI might take a nap
p5568
aVcouldn\u2019t fall asleep from my fucked up sleep schedule from last week
p5569
aVworked on stat a bit last night
p5570
aVfinished CS at 2 pm yesterday haha
p5571
aVnaw I\u2019m super tired
p5572
aVDid you cram CS?
p5573
aVWhoa what but you never partake
p5574
aVi need caffeine
p5575
aVStat forever
p5576
aVSounds good
p5577
aVdo you want to just eat in throp then?
p5578
aVok cool
p5579
aVI'm not
p5580
aValso are you and chris actually doing the faculty dinner thingy today?
p5581
aVPARTAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
p5582
aVYes
p5583
aVyo phil office hours today?
p5584
aVWe Gucci
p5585
aVwe good btw

aVmather dhall or berg?
p5587
aVoh snap
p5588
aVFuck I might have lost my beats in the dhall
p5589
aVneed to review beta for next lecture
p5590
aVstarting stat already?
p5591
aVyes
p5592
aVif so can you send me pics
p5593
aVyo can you check
p5594
aVk
p5595
aVI might have it
p5596
aVif not I might have turned it in with the pset lol
p5597
aVyo could everyone check their notes to see if my stat lecture 16 notes got mixed up in your papers somewhere?
p5598
aVgonna dead
p5599
aVholy crap
p5600
aVdying
p5601
aVugh no coffee at queens head
p5602
aVfinished at about the time I woke up
p5603
ag1
aVchris is good
p5604
aVDo you know if Chris made out ok?
p5605
aVAlthough to be fair I went to bed past 4
p5606
aV#noclassfridays
p5607
aVwhy does class exist
p5608
aVdying
p5609
aVlol
p5610
aVlel up since 7
p5611
aVAnd I just woke up
p5612
aVhttp://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda366h.htm
p5613
aVBut yeah I'm gonna take a few before I jump into stat
p5614
aVTo clarify I'm kidding again
p5615
aVjeez
p5616
aVLol dying
p5617
ag1
ag1
aVNormal
p5618
aVBtw do you guys want to see my mini seizure when they shocked me
p5619
aVWoot
p5620
aVso it will be an actual party
p5621
aVyeah jessica\u2019s coming over as well
p5622
aVand will be playing tf for the rest of tonight
p5623
aVdinner, lifting, practice
p5624
aVWe partying into the night?
p5625
aVBtw Harry what's your schedule like for the rest of today?
p5626
aVJust super tedious and exhausting mental activities
p5627
aVLol nah jk
p5628
aVUgh I can't see
p5629
aVBut for like 4 hours
p5630
aVMinor electrical shocks
p5631
aVwhat did they do to you?
p5632
aVThat was actually probably the worst experience I've had at Harvard
p5633
aVeeg
p5634
aVHoly crap never do psych studies with REEG
p5635
aVI might need to take a break before I can do stat
p5636
aVmore vodka
p5637
aVin that case
p5638
aVThat as pretty much torture
p5639
aVI return from the gulag comrades
p5640
aVThat was so grueling
p5641
aVmore carbs
p5642
aVOmg I am dead
p5643
aVI will be tf on call
p5644
ag1
aValso PSA to keep Phil and Chris in the loop: Stat pset party tonight
p5645
ag1
aVLiterally da real mvp
p5646
aVGood news friends: 4 is done
p5647
aVUgj ate so much
p5648
aVMight be dead by then
p5649
aVBe back around 10
p5650
aVRehearsal
p5651
aVWhere u hdawg
p5652
ag1
aVNaw man I won't be eating
p5653
aVMax carbs
p5654
aVSweet just in time for open house
p5655
aVI'll be back in 15 minutes or so
p5656
aVWill continue to 4
p5657
aVHaving trouble with 2
p5658
ag1
aVGives gifts
p5659
aVBae Matt
p5660
aVI'll think about it later
p5661
aVOk that might be helpful
p5662
aVThen to prove it is equal to the thing find the prob that one RV is greater than another RV
p5663
aVArgh
p5664
aVBut according to Yahweh it's a single integral
p5665
aVThat something is probs the joint PDF
p5666
aVOk
p5667
aVlol that's where I'm at lol
p5668
aVOf something
p5669
aVMust take double integral
p5670
aVIs
p5671
aVAll I got for 4
p5672
aVyeah more or less
p5673
aVeverything else gucci?
p5674
aVI will ask general questions to blitz I suppose
p5675
aVbut besides that i don\u2019t know where to go from there
p5676
aValso it might be helpful to draw out mock distributions for G and H on the interval a,b to see what\u2019s happening
p5677
aVyou have to use little g and little h
p5678
aVand also y itself is an integral
p5679
aVah I see
p5680
aVbut we have to define y and x
p5681
aVintegral from 0 to 1 of ydx
p5682
aVhow do you define a variable in terms of another?
p5683
aVI know it's from 0 to 1
p5684
aVI don't have the integral
p5685
aVhmm a is interesting
p5686
aVB Isn't too bad once we get the intuition
p5687
aVGet an intuitive understanding
p5688
aVSet up the integral for a basically
p5689
aVI'm going to focus on it so I can get the context
p5690
aVDo you have specific questions for 4?
p5691
ag1
aVyeah it\u2019s just 4 at this point
p5692
aVnot so with reading, unfortunately
p5693
aVmusic and math are good complements
p5694
aVi\u2019ve realized that rap is great to bang out tex to
p5695
aVyup literally just go through the list haha
p5696
aVand correlation 0 is the same as covariance 0
p5697
aVI'll review these properties a bit more
p5698
aVyeah I got that
p5699
aVsweet
p5700
aVremember that uncorrelated implies independence
p5701
aVyeah 3 is just straight up covariance properties
p5702
aVthat is also a good tip for 2, thankee thankee
p5703
aVlemme take a look
p5704
aVoh wait nm that\u2019s 2
p5705
aVhint hint rewrite X as something else
p5706
aVit\u2019s all covariance properties
p5707
aVdon\u2019t use expected value
p5708
aVis there a subtle secret to 3?
p5709
aVok cool
p5710
aVYeah
p5711
aVwe definitely know 1,2 and 7 right?
p5712
aVwill do
p5713
aVThat's up to Harry
p5714
aVso I can get good, specific answers from da blitz
p5715
aVwith as much context as you can
p5716
aVbtw send me final questions today by 4
p5717
aVtru dat
p5718
aVwhen yo momma\u2019s birthday falls in the middle of the week you have to act fast
p5719
aVgoddamn harry so fast
p5720
aVDAS FINE
p5721
aVIZ FINE
p5722
aVITS FINE
p5723
aVit\u2019s fine
p5724
aVit\u2019s fine josh
p5725
ag1
ag1
aVand start CS tomorrow HOORAY!!!
p5726
aVi\u2019m probably going to OH to finish up tonight
p5727
aVCuz I'm a fuccboi for this midterm
p5728
aVit\u2019s k
p5729
aVAnd will not start until tomorrow
p5730
aVFair warning I have not started yet
p5731
aVK
p5732
aV4 i have decent intuition for but it\u2019s just not done yet
p5733
aVyeah i did 6 but am just unsure of my answer
p5734
aV4 and 6 left?
p5735
aVYep
p5736
aV7\u2019s actually pretty easy
p5737
aVParse Error: Double negative misunderstanding
p5738
aVAh ok
p5739
aVIt isnt supposed to be
p5740
aVOh wait do you mean that they aren't pretty?
p5741
aVMy ratio isn't clean
p5742
aVCrap
p5743
aVNot particularly
p5744
aVAre the answers to 1 not that pretty?
p5745
aV^never meant to imply that it was haha
p5746
aVyeah chris, word of warning: this week\u2019s pset is not trivial
p5747
aVotherwise we should be all set
p5748
aVbasically 4 or 6 if you get a chance
p5749
aVGoin hard
p5750
aVif you get a chance Phil, ask about 4 tomorrow (though I do have some intuition) so I might figure it out tomorrow
p5751
aVGeeeez man
p5752
aValmost there with #6
p5753
aVyeah they usually are
p5754
aVeh although OH are really busy today
p5755
aVi like going to his OH
p5756
aVnow you see why
p5757
aVthe perks of sitting next to the TF
p5758
aVlow-key gathering intel from other people\u2019s questions to evan
p5759
ag1
aV5 done
p5760
aVYassuh Massah Harry
p5761
aVJust this time is my moms birthday

p5788
aVSugoi

aVgood news: #3 is extremely easy
p5790

p5866
aVyet
p5867
aVdid you get 4b
p5868
aVok i\u2019ll head out
p5869
aVgotcha
p5870
aVok
p5871
aVyes
p5872
aVoh btw a PDF must be in the form f(x), not P(X=x) right?
p5873
aVnothing else
p5874
aVthat's it
p5875
aVI'm up to 5b
p5876
aVuh
p5877
aVoh OH
p5878
aVwhat
p5879
aVwait you are leaving
p5880
aVbefore i leave?
p5881
aVphil any question requests?
p5882
aVok alrighty
p5883
aVjacob-san
p5884
aVoh phew ok
p5885
aVoh wait Jacob as in our jacob
p5886
aVjacobian nooo
p5887
aVI can explain when you return
p5888
aVbut i now see
p5889
aVi was looking without seeing
p5890
aVi got it
p5891
aVwait it does work
p5892
aVjeez hopefully jacobsan will come assist at some point
p5893
aVsound familiar
p5894
aVbut the math isn't following
p5895
aVit
p5896
aVso logically i understand t
p5897
aVi think
p5898
aVyaoweh is providing
p5899
aVhao doe
p5900
aVwtf
p5901
aVnot sure how
p5902
aVthey're indepemdent
p5903
aVchecking now
p5904
aVwait i\u2019m guessing that they\u2019re not independent for 5d then?
p5905
aVk
p5906
aVthen
p5907
aVok i\u2019ll just confirm that we don\u2019t have to evaluate max() in 4b
p5908
aVso not really
p5909
aVwell i have intuition for 6 and 7
p5910
aVany lingering questions you want me to ask while i\u2019m here?
p5911
aVthen dinner
p5912
aVlet's do this
p5913
aVkk
p5914
aVok yeah it\u2019s just piecewise then
p5915
aVi mean i have that
p5916
aVthen use what we got from a
p5917
aVwhich is P(L = a, M = a+b)
p5918
aVuh...
p5919
aVI can imagine
p5920
aVIt's basically P(L=a, M -L =b)
p5921
aVwhat he say?
p5922
aVoh shit
p5923
aVjesus these office hours are crowded
p5924
aVYaoweh has come through
p5925
aVthat\u2019s what the kid next to me got at least
p5926
aVstill working through it
p5927
aVhow so
p5928
aVwat
p5929
aVso 5d is piecewise as well apparently
p5930
aVWhere you at Chris?
p5931
aVYour dad too legit
p5932
aVnoice noice
p5933
aVThankfully for once dumpling houses service wasn't too slow
p5934
aVi'm waiting on yaoweh's response
p5935
aVyas
p5936
aVHeading to office hours
p5937
aVDinner ended early
p5938
aVfor one more blessing
p5939
aVmight have to call upon Yaoweh
p5940
aVOops I meant btw*
p5941
aVBut 5d doe
p5942
aVOk
p5943
aVBra we have 4b figured out
p5944
aVhuray
p5945
aVlol
p5946
aVMy dad randomly showed up and decided to take me out to dinner lol
p5947
aVIf so can you ask about 5d if you get a chance?
p5948
aVYo Chris are you at oh?
p5949
aVvenn
p5950
aVI can't seem to justify that with like a vent diagram
p5951
aVyeah that might be good
p5952
aVI might double check with a TF
p5953
aVHm ok
p5954
aVApparently
p5955
aVHm alrighty
p5956
aVThe complement rule even works for joints?
p5957
aVWhat
p5958
aVHow dat
p5959
aVWait srsly
p5960
aVWhat
p5961
aVTrivial
p5962
aVOh it's 1-what you got lol
p5963
aVThink
p5964
aVIt hunk it's nontrivial
p5965
aVRemember I don't know how to find the CDF
p5966
aVYou should be right on that one
p5967
aVDo you have 4b figured out?
p5968
aVit\u2019s funny because i\u2019m sitting in the first row too haha
p5969
ag1
aVgg
p5970
aVyeah this cs lecture just turned into a group chat with jessica and josh about 5 lol
p5971
aVGot it
p5972
aVyo phil focus efforts on 5d and 7 (really just 5d)
p5973
aVjk thanks haha
p5974
aVtrynin to sabotage me bruh?
p5975
aVI'll leave it outside your door
p5976
aVMy bad brah
p5977
aVIt was actually in my folder the entire time
p5978
aVBtw Harry I found your pset
p5979
ag1
aVOk I will join y'all at some point
p5980
aVHave progress with 4b but stumped
p5981
aVWorking out now
p5982
aVHopefully we can write up most of the pset tonight
p5983
aVComing back soon
p5984
aVmagnificent
p5985
aVIntel
p5986
aVyeah, if company 1 survives after time x_1, and company 2 survives after time x_2, what can you say about when the 2 disasters or the stock market crashes happen? well the stock market crash must happen after max(x_1, x_2), and disaster 1 needs to happen after x_1, and disaster 2 must happen after x_2. Those 3 are independent, so multiply their probabilities
p5987

p6011
aVyup
p6012
aVYou guys in sc?
p6013
ag1
aVright now
p6014
aVAlso i should probably pay attention to lecture
p6015
aVso 4 and 5 (the latter parts) we should probably ask about
p6016
aVhmm ok
p6017
aVI don't remember seeing it
p6018
aVUnclear
p6019
aVi did 5a but i\u2019m stuck from there
p6020
aVUmm
p6021
aVdo you know 5 josh?
p6022
aVIs k
p6023
aVgotcha
p6024
aV6 is fine
p6025
aVAnd 6
p6026
aVok 4 then
p6027
aV4 less so
p6028
aV7 is gonna be fine
p6029
aVok
p6030
aVprepend a "QUESTION FOR BLITZ" so I can see it in the message
p6031
aV4 and 7 yo
p6032
aVpost them here
p6033
aVbtw are there questions you guys want me to prep for blitz
p6034
aVok I'll think about it
p6035
aVhmmm
p6036
aVah I see
p6037
aVfor us to remain in the unit ball
p6038
aVremember that the sum of the squares of all of the Uj must be less than 1
p6039
aVhmm
p6040
aVk
p6041
aVnuu
p6042
aVfar less than that
p6043
aVnope
p6044
aVn-1
p6045
aVhow many of Uj can be 1/sqrt(2) or greater in order for us to still remain within the unit ball?
p6046
aVthink about it more intuitively
p6047
aVhm ok
p6048
aVignore that part
p6049
aVor at least the formula that we got
p6050
aVignore it
p6051
aVif we're approx 3a how do it ignore it?
p6052
aVwait so we ignore 3a or 3c?
p6053
aVyup
p6054
aVi can explain 3
p6055
aVI think we got 3
p6056
aVbasically the idea is to approximate 3a using limits
p6057
aVI still don't know how to do 3
p6058
aVit\u2019s misleading
p6059
aVk
p6060
aVwat
p6061
aV6 and 7 are good
p6062
aVi.e. the "simple" proof of the prob goes to zero as n->inf
p6063
aVfor 3d ignore 3a
p6064
aVAsk Harry for 3 and 4
p6065
aVi still need to do 4, most of 5 and 7
p6066
aVtips for 3d?
p6067
aVhow are you guys doing?
p6068
aV:(
p6069
aVAlso can't really pull up the solutions now
p6070
aVHaven't done it yet
p6071
aVas the answer that is
p6072
aVdid you get 1?
p6073
aVHave you guys done 6 yet?
p6074
aVk
p6075
aVThink about 2d and 3D cases
p6076
aVi'll work on it at some point this week
p6077
aVNaive def
p6078
aVk
p6079
aVuh
p6080
aVnoice
p6081
aVDon't overthink it
p6082
aVWe got 3a
p6083
aVthe intuition is strong for 6 and 7
p6084
aV4 and 5 as well i think
p6085
aVdefinitely question 3
p6086
aVif I were to buy a lottery ticket with 1<n<7 numbers, which numbers from 1 to 7 should I choose to increase my chances?
p6087
aVrather
p6088
aVjosh which problems do you feel strongly about
p6089
aVThanks but I think I'm good haha
p6090
aVYou're welcome to come if you want haha
p6091
aVI'm going to team practice
p6092
aVHarry what time you lifting today
p6093
aVI'm almost there
p6094
aVDon't overthink it
p6095
aVis 1c 3/4?
p6096
aVcoolcool
p6097
aVyeah I'm here already
p6098
aVok
p6099
aVif you wanna meet earlier
p6100
aValso i\u2019m heading to winthrop immediately after lecture so i should be there before 3
p6101
aV1d try to graph out inequalities involving the 2 rv\u2019s on the plane and remember that probability is proportional to area
p6102
aV1c notice that the arrival times are independent of one another
p6103
aVhmm k
p6104
aVas in, how do we account for the fact that we don't know who is second
p6105
aV1d i did graphically
p6106
aVhow did you guys approach 1c and 1d?
p6107
aVok
p6108
aVoooooooooh
p6109
aVhttp://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sugoi
p6110
aVthank a you
p6111
aVmake a sense
p6112
aVok
p6113
aVSince 0<y<x<L
p6114
aV\u2026derp
p6115
aVIt's just y to L
p6116
aValso what the hell is sugoi?
p6117
aVL-y to L?
p6118
aVSugoi
p6119
aVyes i am
p6120
aVHarry you coming to OH in throp?
p6121
aVSo what is the interval of x with respect to L AND y?
p6122
aVright...
p6123
aVAnd y is also between 0 and x
p6124
aVYou know x is between 0 and L
p6125
aVYeah the integral is correct but the limits of integration are wrong
p6126
aVHang on
p6127
aVNot the joint one
p6128
aVWait I think you integrate the conditional pdf
p6129
aVwhat am i doing wrong bruh
p6130
aVin which case the integral for 1/Lx does not converge
p6131
aVthe problem is my bounds are 0 to L
p6132
aVSounds correct
p6133
aVfor 2d you just integrate the joint pdf with respect to x right?
p6134
aVtrue
p6135
aVTechnically you could it just wouldn't be accurate
p6136
aVwish i could take the credit
p6137
aVHoly shit that's some quality editing

aVahahahahahahahahahaha
p6152
aVyou best take notes chris

p6156
ag1
ag1
ag1
aVok I'll have to see what I can do later tonight
p6157
aVaw damn
p6158
aVStrong intuition indicates Harry is correct
p6159
aVinteresting
p6160
aVBut I could be wrong
p6161
aVI got the complement each of that
p6162
aVyeah I'm doing this incorrectly
p6163
aVone
p6164
aVuh
p6165
aVIs that one for both or one?
p6166
aVis it 1/4?
p6167

aVWe will keep you posted on updates to this developing story as we receive them
p6171
aVThis is not a drill
p6172
aVPSA: A Mr. Felizardo has reportedly sighted the BAE of a Mr. Chen in the wild
p6173
aVi mean polite refusal would be fine
p6174
aVwhat's the plan with Blitz's email?
p6175
aVYes
p6176
aVAre you guys skipping again?
p6177
aV*dripping sarcasm*
p6178
aVcould take a hit
p6179
aVwrath of blitz
p6180
aVi mean may GPA was too high to begin with anyway
p6181
aVand watch the stat grade plummet
p6182
aVdo it
p6183
aVlol
p6184
aV"Thank you professor for your suggestions too bad we'll use them on pther professors because you were our third choice"
p6185
aVFor what? We don't want to do classroom to table with him?
p6186
aVIt's polite
p6187
aVWhy do we need an excuse
p6188
aVWe wouldn't have considered doing the dinner in the first place
p6189
aVIs that we're busy
p6190
aVIf our excuse
p6191
aVMight still be suspicious
p6192
aVI invited Jacob lol
p6193
aVOh
p6194
aVbut he suggested some alternatives
p6195
aVhe can\u2019t go
p6196
aVAnd now no longer want to go to the dinner thingy
p6197
aVWait did you guys invite him
p6198
aVvalid excuse methinks
p6199
aVshould we go ahead and say we'll look into classroom to table a little later in the semester when our midterms are over?
p6200
aVbtw we should reply to blitzstein
p6201
aVI just want to see what he says
p6202
aVwell I mean, that's what makes it funny, right?
p6203
aVso forward
p6204
aVwhat a motivator
p6205
aVlol chris
p6206
aVBecause those TFs likely were faculty
p6207
aVpeople definitely invited TFs to freshman faculty dinner
p6208
aVGood luck rescinding that in a not awkward way
p6209
aVit's ok
p6210
ag1
aVwhoops
p6211
aVok maybe not
p6212
ag1
aVThey definitely don't
p6213
aVlo
p6214
aVlol
p6215
aVlol
p6216
aVlol

aVHe's not faculty
p6222
ag1
aVInvite to own house's faculty dinner pro plus
p6223
aVBut super hilarious nonetheless
p6224
aVWait probably can't count as faculty
p6225
aVActually though
p6226
aVLol lets invite Jacob
p6227
aVBummer that we can't get dinner with any of our professors this semester though
p6228
aVHaha yeah
p6229
aVEven suggests alternatives
p6230
aVDamn Blitz is maximum nice
p6231
aVdone and done
p6232
aVpro
p6233
aVYeah sure why not
p6234
aVHarry do you want us to write your name in the email?
p6235
aVOr you can do it during office hours
p6236
aVShould've asked during open house
p6237
aVi wouldn\u2019t mind blitz
p6238
aVi mean you can try
p6239
aVRehearsal then section
p6240
aVI won't be there
p6241
aVI'm assuming faculty dinner is a no?
p6242
aVno feedback yet
p6243
ag1
aVso theres that
p6244
aVwell at least you didn\u2019t have to suck his dick
p6245
aVLife is weird sometimes
p6246

p6247
aVaint you special
p6248
aV#connections #blitzsenpainoticedme
p6249
aVTalked to blitz and he remembered me
p6250
aVi just grabbed a bunch and am now feasting on the 4th floor
p6251
aVIt's free so why not
p6252
aVLoll
p6253
aVhits the spot
p6254
aVthis crappy yenching doe
p6255
aVStahp
p6256
aVStahp David melon
p6257
aVyou do not want to start the foray into cs with an upper level class lol
p6258
aVI missed the timing when everyone else was taking it
p6259
aVDamn
p6260
aVno take 50 haha
p6261
aVUnless there's another CS course that would be better
p6262
aVew
p6263
aVUgh
p6264
aVAs well
p6265
aVI guess I'll end up taking CS50
p6266
aVGoddamnit
p6267
aVwinkwink
p6268
aVwell it\u2019ll definitely be less than a cs class haha
p6269
aVSo I'm not sure whether I wanna
p6270
aVBut it's supposed to be a lot of work too
p6271
aVWhich would be useful for research potentially
p6272
aVIt's supposed to be more of a writing/presentation course
p6273
aVhe said most people do the thesis without the tutorial
p6274
aVI asked about the tutorial
p6275
aVHuh
p6276
aVReally
p6277
aVand just start thinking about it early
p6278
aValso he just said not to worry too much about the thesis
p6279
aVYeah
p6280
aVi mean cs stat is fairly common
p6281
aVit's gucci
p6282
aVDid he say you were trippin
p6283
aVWhat did he say about joint
p6284
aVi talked to bae
p6285
aVDid you talk to peoples
p6286
aVFor concentrations
p6287
aVNot as requirements
p6288
aVI thought you meant double counting as in probability
p6289
aVOh
p6290
aVHavent checked
p6291
aVI lost 2 points for something I can't remember what
p6292
aV?
p6293
aVDid you miss a problem on the last pset
p6294
aVHooray for double counting
p6295
aVKoolaid
p6296
aVNoooooooo
p6297
aVDrink the koi laid
p6298
aVHaha
p6299
ag1
aVLooks like a CS course might become a requirement for stat concentrator a
p6300
ag1
ag1
aVHE SEES YOU
p6301
aVYaaaaaass
p6302
aVYes
p6303
aVthere we go
p6304
ag1
aVdamn preview not cropping correctly
p6305
aVhm this is not having the effect I anticipated
p6306
ag1
ag1
ag1
aVoui ou non?
p6307
aVgilbert and sandel turned us down
p6308
aVyou guys want to get blitz for the faculty dinner?
p6309
aVyeah
p6310
aVyo josh you said that you think you\u2019ll go to the stat thing at 1?
p6311
aVand she might
p6312
aVgood
p6313
aVyes
p6314
aVright?
p6315
aVconfirmed t>0
p6316
aVand he confirmed
p6317
aVi asked the yaoster
p6318
aVis she coming to check
p6319
aV*her
p6320
aVbut if jessica comes to check you can ask ger
p6321
aVwon't be back until late
p6322
aVShow me when I get back
p6323
aVAgain
p6324
aVlol resubmit
p6325
aVhow
p6326
aVwait what
p6327
aVnot 1
p6328
aVit's for any t > 0
p6329
aVi was wrong
p6330
aValso
p6331
aVyes, should be
p6332
aVWhich is the same as diverging right?
p6333
aVsince e^t3x goes to infinity faster than e^x in that case
p6334
aVi think it was infinite when t>1
p6335
aVyolo
p6336
aVi\u2019ll just write that it diverges for t>=1
p6337
aVok coolcool
p6338
aVbecause it only works if t>1, it doesn't satisfy that condition
p6339
aVit must be finite on (-a,a) for some a>0
p6340
aVremember the conditions
p6341
aVthe mgf doesn't exist
p6342
aVBut I thought the mgf does not exist
p6343
aVWtf
p6344
aVI'm just writing that
p6345
aVthe integral converges if t<1
p6346
aVyolo
p6347
aVsomething with gamma function
p6348
aVwolfram gives me an answer :/
p6349
aVah ok
p6350
aVwe can ask josh later
p6351
aVi might need to revise then
p6352
aVok
p6353
aVor t<1 or something
p6354
aVthat\u2019s all i have
p6355
aVI think josh mentioned as long as t is positive we good
p6356
aVit\u2019s infinite
p6357
aVdiverges?
p6358
aVis that all you have written?
p6359
aVit diverges
p6360
aVby parts?
p6361
aVfrom 0 to infty
p6362
aVI have e^{x^3 (t-1)}
p6363
aVyo anyone have mo tips for 7c integral?
p6364
aVaight
p6365
aVok
p6366
aValso phil i have a slight addendum for 4c
p6367
aVon my way
p6368
aVi will help if y\u2019all come back
p6369
aVgotcha
p6370
aVi\u2019m in my underwear
p6371
aVi just showered

p6373
aVyo got tips for 7c?
p6374
aVcome to 26?
p6375
aVin my room
p6376
aVyo harry where you at
p6377
aVi mean *GOMD
p6378
aVGMOD blitzstein
p6379
aVgg
p6380
aV1799 buses arriving simultaneously and then 1 arriving 3 hours later
p6381
aV6 hast been solved
p6382
aVugh failing
p6383
aVstill doing 6
p6384
aVdid you guys get that the mean for 7b is 6?
p6385
aVour brave stat warriors
p6386
aVi just woke up and i see this lol
p6387
ag1
aVah I think it's just a normal integral
p6388
ag1
aVPlease leave a message after the tone
p6389
aVBrain is not in stat mode right now
p6390
aVUmm
p6391
aVit is useful for 6 I think
p6392
aVIs that for 6 or 7
p6393
aVLol wut
p6394
ag1
aVdoes anyone understand this?
p6395
aVWorking on 6 also
p6396
aVGotcha
p6397
aV/do 6
p6398
aVI still need to finish 6
p6399
aVBut I'll let you know once I start it
p6400
aVDon't have it in front of me
p6401
aVHints for 7?
p6402
aVI have the solution for 5 and 7
p6403
aVI meant 6
p6404
aVdat vintage feel doe
p6405
aVi\u2019ve fallen in love with Hold On, We\u2019re Going Home from Nothing was the same
p6406
aVJust tell me prior to 4pm
p6407
aVI will verify whatever remaining problems we have with the blitz tomorrow
p6408
aVNoice
p6409
aVlol
p6410
aV5 is too easy
p6411
aVPretty sure I figured out 4
p6412
aVWork on 5
p6413
aVah I see
p6414
aVSo I expanded
p6415
aVCouldn't find numbers for 100 minutes
p6416
aVhuh I see
p6417
aVYeah
p6418
aVwait so you have 20 buses?
p6419
aVIt shouldn't matter for those
p6420
aVThe other 19 go into the 10 remaining minutes somehow
p6421
aV1 is 190
p6422
aVBecause there are 20 possible wait times
p6423
aVNo
p6424
aVWell it just has to be greater than 60
p6425
aVbecause the average time between buses is then 95.5
p6426
aVare you certain
p6427
aVwait what
p6428
aVah ok
p6429
aVBut the property is proven at that point
p6430
aVYou have to add everything else
p6431
aVAnd 90.25 is the average wait time of for Fred in that interval
p6432
aVAccident
p6433
ag1
aVwhat does 90.25 represent?
p6434
ag1
aVok
p6435
aVright
p6436
aVwut
p6437
aVIdk
p6438
aV190/2?
p6439
aVwhy multiply by 95?
p6440
aVSo it should be fine
p6441
aVIs 90.25
p6442
aVWell 190*95/200
p6443
aVdoes it work?
p6444
aVAnd let one interval be 190 minutes
p6445
aVCould do out of 200 minutes
p6446
aVFuck this shit
p6447
aVI can't find numbers extreme enough...
p6448
aVDivide by 2
p6449
aVYou're right
p6450
aVLet me check
p6451
aVEww
p6452
aVI see what you're saying
p6453
aVat minute 79 of the 80 minute interval, his wait time is 1 min
p6454
aVWait
p6455
aVOh
p6456
aVat minute 1 of the 80 minute interval, his wait time is 80 mins
p6457
aVso in the 80 minute interval
p6458
aVthat's at least how I interpret the textbook question
p6459
aVYeah
p6460
aVbut the long interval is more minutes than short interval
p6461
aVeach minute is equally likely
p6462
aVRight?
p6463
aVLength bias
p6464
aVWhich they're not
p6465
aVThat's assuming they're equally likely
p6466
aVaverages to 40
p6467
aVmin is 1
p6468
aVbecause the max is 80
p6469
aVthe average should be 40 right?
p6470
aVEvan has been circulating
p6471
aVLet me check to make sure
p6472
aVwat\u005c
p6473
aVwar
p6474
aVI think
p6475
aVBut the wait time for Fred is still on average 80 minutes in that interval
p6476
aVThere are 80 possible ways for him to arrive in the 80 minute interval
p6477
aVif he arrives at the last minute of that 80 min interval he only needs to wait one minute right?
p6478
aVwhy 80 x 80 rather than 80 +79 +78 ...
p6479
ag1
aVWhich is 64
p6480
aVThe first term is 80x80/100
p6481
aVYeah
p6482
aVWell we're working discretely
p6483
aVare you certain his average wait time is over 60 mins?
p6484
aVassuming he arrives at the beginning of each minute
p6485
aVSince each wait is not equally likely
p6486
aVBut the average wait for Fred is different
p6487
aVAnd the average of an individual wait is 100/10=10
p6488
aVSo that the number of possible waits is 10
p6489
aVWhat Harry said
p6490
aVthere are seven 1 minute waits i assume
p6491
aVhe has seven intervals that he could arrive in?
p6492
aVwhat do you mean by 7x1 minute waits
p6493
aVThen compute the different averages
p6494
aVI had possible wait times as 80 minutes, 10 minutes, 3 minutes, and 7x 1 minute waits
p6495
aVJust pick numbers that show both an average bus-bus time is 10 minutes, but average Fred-bus time is over 60 minutes
p6496
aVdas it mane
p6497
aV3b complete
p6498
aVexcellent
p6499
ag1
aVnow that there are no more distracting men prancing around on ice
p6500
aVjust starting now
p6501
aVGonna start tonight
p6502
aVhow's stat coming along

p6575
aVwhoops
p6576
aV\u005csubsection{Fisher Exact Test}\u000aFind conditional distribution of $X_1|(X_1+X_2=t)$ given that $X_1\u005csim Bin(n,p_1)$, $X_2\u005csim Bin(m,p_2)$, $p_1=p_2$, and $n$ and $m$ are known constants. \u005ctextbf{Answer:}\u000aBy Bayes' rule,\u000a\u005c[X_1|(X_1+X_2=t)\u005csim HGeom(n,m,r)\u005c]

p6618
aVdon't see how P(Y<1+X) -> P(Y \u005cleq X)
p6619
aVanyone understand 5c for 2007?
p6620
aVhgeom converges to binomial np as w+b goes to infinity but if p = w/(w+b) isfixed
p6621
aVmight be worth noting the connections between distributions
p6622
aVpro +
p6623
aVthe other sorts by gender first and picks disease
p6624
aVone assumes disease/no disease first and then assigns gender after the fact
p6625
aVah ok
p6626
aVhe said it was the same in lecture
p6627
aVyah
p6628
aVmight be the same
